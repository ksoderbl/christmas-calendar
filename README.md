# christmas-calendar
Christmas calendar written in C and OpenGL in 2001, updated in 2018.
The original had 24 effects, I have removed those that I did not
program and a few more, so some only have an empty starfield as
the effect.

Effects

The demo begins with a christmas calendar on the screen. You can click
on the christmas calendar hatches with the left mouse button to select
an effect to run or you can press keyboard buttons F1-F12 to run
effects 1 to 12 or F1-F12 + shift to run effects 13-24.

The keys to control the demo (most work in all effects) are:

key                     effect
Arrow keys              rotate or move (depending on effect)
Page Up/Page Down       zoom or look up and down
z and x                 rotate around z-axis (in some effects)
m                       messages on/off
space                   effect specific
ESC                     quit effect / whole demo
r                       reset the effect (for some effects, also for calendar)
p                       pause
